<h1 id="course-description">Course description</h1>
<p>The last 20 years have seen the <a
href="https://www.r-project.org/">R programming language</a> rise in
popularity from a language used and developed primarily by statisticians
to one used and developed by anyone interested in analyzing and
visualizing data from scientists and engineers to historians and
journalists. This <strong>two-credit</strong> seminar aims to provide a
brief introduction (i.e., a <em>crash course</em>) to using R for
analyzing and visualizing data. As R and other scripting languages have
become more popular, so have the tools required to document, maintain,
share, and replicate analyses and visualization. These activities
constitute “literate programming” and “reproducible research”, and we
will use some of these tools (particularly <a
href="https://quarto.org/"><code>Quarto</code></a>).</p>
<p>Prerequisites: None.</p>
<h1 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student learning outcomes</h1>
<ol type="1">

</ol>
<h1 id="course-format">Course format</h1>
<p>Each week will consist of a short introduction and interactive
demonstration of the concepts and tools for that week followed by a
short lab where students apply the concepts and tools. There may be
preliminary readings to do before class for some weeks (see “Topic
schedule” below and check back for updates); please make sure to do
those so that we make the most of time in class.</p>

<p>The assessment portion of the course has three components.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Class attendance.</li>
<li>Completion of the lab component that we begin in class. This must be
turned in as a markdown document. If there are datasets that are
required for the analysis (<em>other than datasets provided as part of
the lab or lecture</em>), these should be provided along with the
<code>Quarto</code> markdown file (with last name <code>qmd</code>) by
adding all the files to a single compressed <code>zip</code> file. The
<code>qmd</code> or <code>zip</code> file should then be uploaded to the
<a href="https://uk.instructure.com/courses/2041707">Canvas course
website</a>.</li>
<li>Project presentation. The last two classes will be devoted to 8-10
minute presentations of <strong>five</strong> figures that present data
from <strong><em>one or two datasets</em></strong> of your choice. The
figures should be “publication quality” in terms of aesthetics
(labeling, font size, colors, etc) but do not need a caption (that’s
what the talk is for!). The markdown source code and any necessary data
files must be submitted to the Canvas website as a <code>zip</code>
file; compiling the markdown file (with <code>Quarto</code>) should
produce the figures as they were presented during the lightning talk. If
you want a challenge, you can even write your slides in markdown
too!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips-for-making-sure-i-can-run-your-r-code.">Tips for making
sure I can run your R code.</h2>
<ul>
<li>For every assignment, create a separate folder for each assignment
and put the <code>.qmd</code> file and all the other necessary files
(data files, images, etc) in that folder.</li>
<li>Zip the contents of that folder (or the folder itself) and submit
that to Canvas.</li>
<li>Use <em>relative</em> directories when pointing to files. Relative
directories begin simply the name of the file or subdirectory of the
current directory (I use relative directories in all the course
<code>.qmd</code> files). That is, <strong>avoid</strong> directories
like <code>C:\Documents\student\R\stuff\stuff.jpg</code> and instead
simply put <code>stuff.jpg</code> if its in the same directory as the
<code>.qmd</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure your analyses run without errors and your
<code>.qmd</code> can be compiled into a <code>.html</code> file
successfully by first typing <code>rm(list=ls())</code> into the R
console and then compiling the file. This will start your workspace from
scratch and is also a good way of preventing the problem where an
analysis worked when you closed R but now doesn’t when you reopen
it.</li>

full description of UK academic policies.</p>
<h2 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>Members of the course are entitled to learn from each other in an
open and welcoming environment regardless of their racial, ethnic,
gender, and sexual identities. Conduct that is not respectful of these
identities or of the national origin, religion, and political beliefs
students and instructors will not be tolerated. Please report any
concerning conduct to the instructor.</p>
<h2 id="face-coveringdistancing-policy">Face Covering/Distancing
Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Transmission of COVID-19 is still prevalent in Kentucky. The
instructor and students are entitled to practices that reduce
transmission including, and not limited to, wearing a high-quality mask
and social distancing.</p></li>
<li><p>In accordance with University guidelines, these transmission
reducing practices are optional but the instructor encourages them. If
COVID-19 is a specific risk to a student or a student has any concerns
about classroom COVID-19 policies, please contact the instructor as soon
as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>More information about COVID-19 and UK can be found here: <a

</ul>
<h2 id="excused-absences">Excused Absences</h2>
<p>Students need to notify the instructor of absences prior to class
when possible. Senate Rule Senate Rules 5.2.5.2.1 defines the following
as acceptable reasons for excused absences: (a) significant illness, (b)
death of a family member, (c) trips for members of student organizations
sponsored by an educational unit, trips for University classes, and
trips for participation in intercollegiate athletic events, (d) major
religious holidays, (e) interviews for graduate/professional school or
full-time employment post-graduation, and (f) other circumstances found
to fit “reasonable cause for nonattendance” by the professor.</p>
<p>Students anticipating an absence for a major religious holiday are
responsible for notifying the instructor in writing of anticipated
absences due to their observance of such holidays no later than the last
day in the semester to add a class. Information regarding major
religious holidays may be obtained through the Ombud (859-257-3737, <a
href="https://www.uky.edu/ombud/religious-observances"
class="uri">https://www.uky.edu/ombud/religious-observances</a>).
Students are expected to withdraw from the class if more than 20% of the
classes scheduled for the semester are missed (excused or unexcused) per
university policy.</p>
<h2 id="verification-of-absences">Verification of Absences</h2>
<p>Students may be asked to verify their absences in order for them to
be considered excused. Senate Rule 5.2.5.2.1 states that faculty have
the right to request appropriate verification when students claim an
excused absence due to: significant illness; death in the household,
trips for classes, trips sponsored by an educational unit and trips for
participation related to intercollegiate athletic events; and interviews
for full-time job opportunities after graduation and interviews for
graduate and professional school.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Per university policy, students shall not plagiarize, cheat, or
falsify or misuse academic records. Students are expected to adhere to
University policy on cheating and plagiarism in all courses. The minimum
penalty for a first offense is a zero on the assignment on which the
offense occurred. If the offense is considered severe or the student has
other academic offenses on their record, more serious penalties, up to
suspension from the university may be imposed.</p>
<p>Plagiarism and cheating are serious breaches of academic conduct.
Each student is advised to become familiar with the various forms of
academic dishonesty as explained in the Code of Student Rights and
Responsibilities. Complete information can be found at the following
website: <a href="https://www.uky.edu/ombud/"
class="uri">https://www.uky.edu/ombud/</a>. A plea of ignorance is not
acceptable as a defense against the charge of academic dishonesty. It is
important that you review this information as all ideas borrowed from
others need to be properly credited.</p>

Huguelet Drive in the Multidisciplinary Science Building, Suite 407. You
can reach them via phone at (859) 257-2754, via email (<a

website (<a href="https://www.uky.edu/DisabilityResourceCenter/"

accommodations are not retroactive and should therefore be established
with the DRC as early in the semester as is feasible.</p>
